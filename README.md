# 3dod_cv_workshop
Computer Vision Workshop for aUToronto 3D Object Detection Team

## Getting Started
This release is tested on Python 3.7.9, but I expect all Python 3.X versions to work just fine.  

There are 2 (two) ways to get started on this practice.  

1. JupyterHub, a teaching platform that has a built-in runtime environment to run the notebook directly in the browser.  
Once you open this [link to JupyterHub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/ZJC1013/3dod_cv_workshop&branch=main), you will be asked to log in using your UofT UTORid. Then a git repository will be automatically synchronized to your JupyterHub homepage.  

2. Clone this repo and work on the notebook locally.  
```
git clone https://github.com/ZJC1013/3dod_cv_workshop
cd 3dod_cv_workshop
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install necessary packages    
```
